Forecast fundraising outcomes in crowdfunding using functional principal components analysis(fPCA)

### Background
Online crowdfunding is regarded as an effective way to raise money, but its biggest limitation is that the creators and backers can not predict whether the fund-raising project will succeed. This article mainly solves this problem. We first explored the nature and heterogeneity of fund-raising dynamics, then compared the successful group with the unsuccessful group, followed by exploratory data analysis and introduced a new dynamic model to predict the results of crowd financing. This model has made great progress compared with the traditional model.
